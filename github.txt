how to use github correctly

the repository must by synced on both ends before making any changes

assuming changes have been made on the pythonanywhere server side, sync it first:

1. open the console
2. git add .
3. git commit -m 'message'
4. git push -u origin

this will update the master to match the pythonanywhere server side

on the local pc side vscode should give an option to sync

if there are changes on the local side that are not on the server side

use vs code to commit and push

then open the pythonanywhere console and use fetch / merge
